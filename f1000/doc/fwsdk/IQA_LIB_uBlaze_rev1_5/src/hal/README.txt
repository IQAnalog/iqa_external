=======

This directory contains an example IQA Library Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
which provides hardware dependent SPI access to the F1000.

This HAL runs on an Atmel SAMV71 microcontroller running the NuttX operating system
with an F1000 SPI driver on the F1000 EVM.  This code is provided only as an example
of the functinality required in the HAL.  A custom HAL must be developed for the
specific hardware platform for the customer's product.
