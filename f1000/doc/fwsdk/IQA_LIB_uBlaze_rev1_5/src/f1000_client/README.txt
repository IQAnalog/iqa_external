This application is inteneded to be a HOST (i.e. Ubuntu) built 
binary for connecting and communicating with the F1000 server.
It is contained in the NuttX apps/f1000 directory simply because
that is a good place to host it.

To build, you must install libreadline-dev on your Ubuntu host:

   sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
